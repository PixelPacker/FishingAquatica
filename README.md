# What is Fishing Aquatica
Fishing Aquatica is a mod that aims to rework the reward experience in Minecraft fishing to provide a more rewarding and exciting experience.

## How does this improve fishing in Minecraft?
It provides brand new tiers of fishing rods Gold, Iron, Diamond, and Netherite to allow players to invest in fishing rods that will last them much longer. 
And the best feature yet is FISHING LOOT BOXES! While fishing players have a chance to get a Fishing Loot Crate that can either be used as decoration around the base or be broken to explode some nice juicy exciting loot!
